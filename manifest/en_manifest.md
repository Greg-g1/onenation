 Manifest // ONE NATION
 ======================

#### Whereas

Earth is a massive living organism.  
An infinity of life forms coexist interdependently.  
Humanity holds a major influence over other terrestrial realms.  
Each human being is a unique and individualized cell of the planet.  
Organisms' resilience is upheld when cells are free to play their roles for the Whole and Its parts.

#### I proclaim

My gratitude towards Life that animates all things.  
My deep respect for all inhabitants of our earthly spaceship.  
The primacy of the biological and conscious being that I am, over the legal entity created after my birth.  
The legitimacy of my creative power as long as it excludes any form of theft, deception, moral or physical violence.  
The absolute responsibility for my thoughts, words and actions of my own free-will.

#### I undertake

To remove fear so that, with love, I take care of myself and every form of life.   
To seize my power as a living Human Being and use it to create harmony.  
To resort in joyful and pacific disobedience whenever fundamental rights of Life are in danger.

_I acknowledge this pact made between myself and the Earth. Wholeheartedly, I join the Free Beings of One Nation across all oceans and continents._
